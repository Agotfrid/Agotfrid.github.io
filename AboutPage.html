                <p>My name is Alexander Gotfrid, <br>

                    <p> I am attending Business
                        Information Technology Program at Red River College and working towards a title of Full Stack
                        Web Developerer.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        I am a continuous learner who always strives to improve and grow as an individual and my goal is
                        to
                        become a Full Stack web developer. In addition to my college courses, I am regularly taking
                        courses
                        at Udemy and Linda, and currently working on my skills in React, Python and Ruby. My passion for
                        programming and project development led me to learn a variety of programming languages and
                        technologies. In my spare time I enjoy building applications and websites.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        I am the owner of Alexander Gotfrid Enterprise (A.G.E), which focuses on
                        <b>software and web development</b>, <b>network design and
                            low voltage cable installations.</b>
                    </p><br>
                    <p>In the past I have been managing a painting franchise with College Pro.
                        Immediately before becoming a franchise owner, I have worked as a professional
                        painter before taking over the College Pro.
                        My team and I have completed over 100 exterior and interior
                        residential projects in the Winnipeg and Steinbach area.
                        Every single year our focus is to provide exceptional customer service and
                        quality of work. The pride we take in our work and our
                        customer-centric approach has allowed myself and my
                        team to enjoy high degrees of satisfaction from
                        many clients.</p> <br>

                    <p>Operating a robust painting business has been a
                        tremendously fulfilling experience; it channeled my
                        passion towards entrepreneurship and allowed me to learn and developed leadership,
                        public speaking, team building and management skills.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>I am currently seeking new opportunities as a Software Developer. 
                    </p><br>
